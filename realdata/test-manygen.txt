The ruling authorities actually should pay attention to these kinds of capitulators and traitors of China ! Comrade Deng Xiaoping once said that the Communist Party will not be overthrown - if it falls , it will be brought down from within the party itself . Former US Ambassador to China Mr. Huntsman once said in a speech in the US : we will raise eight hundred thousand spokespeople in China , let the Chinese themselves topple China - and the CIA then used an annual eight million yuan subsidy to help these domestic so-called elite , vowing that they want to let them raise the wind to make waves domestically , citizens definitely need to be alert for this and can not let outsiders use us .
